# Arducam quad-camera recording

`recorder.py` sends the Arducam B0267 aggregate frame directly from
`libcamera`/`rpicam-vid` to H.264 and disk. Python never receives or copies a
frame.

The HAT's default four-in-one mode is one horizontal `5120x720` RAW8 image:
four synchronized `1280x720` camera images side by side. The default config
uses the Pi ISP to scale that to `3840x540`, retaining all four images at
`960x540` each. This keeps the software encode near the pixel count of 1080p.

## Use from Python

Start is non-blocking. Always stop in a `finally` block so the encoder flushes:

```python
from video import record

recording = record("/mnt/video/session_001.h264")
try:
    run_time_sensitive_operation()
finally:
    recording.stop()
```

Or use a context manager:

```python
with record("/mnt/video/session_001.h264"):
    run_time_sensitive_operation()
```

For a fixed duration:

```python
recording = record("/mnt/video/test.h264", duration_seconds=10)
saved_path = recording.wait()
```

For the intended four-hour session, passing a duration also enables a free-space
check before the camera starts. The recording can still be stopped early:

```python
recording = record("/mnt/nvme/session_001.h264", duration_seconds=4 * 60 * 60)
try:
    run_time_sensitive_operation()
finally:
    recording.stop()
```

The recorder refuses to overwrite a file unless `overwrite=True` is passed.

## Live preview

Run the lightweight four-camera preview with:

```bash
python -m video.live_preview
```

It requests the configured camera mode and frame rate, displays the complete
four-camera strip in a `1280x180` native preview window, and shows the measured
FPS in the title bar. Close the window to exit. The script replaces itself with
`rpicam-hello`, so there is no Python frame loop, copying, or encoding. Override
the display size with `--width` and `--height`; this changes only the preview
stream, not the selected sensor mode.

## Command-line check

Inspect the command without touching the camera:

```bash
python -m video.recorder /mnt/video/test.h264 --duration 10 --dry-run
```

Record ten seconds:

```bash
python -m video.recorder /mnt/video/test.h264 --duration 10
```

The `.h264` elementary stream is intentional: it has no muxing process, it is
still usable if recording is interrupted, and it minimizes work during the
experiment. Remux afterward without re-encoding if MP4 is wanted:

```bash
ffmpeg -fflags +genpts -r 30 -i test.h264 -c:v copy test.mp4
```

## Raspberry Pi setup

This camera is an Arducam Pivariety device and needs Arducam's matching driver
and `rpicam-apps`. Follow the current Arducam CamArray quick-start guide. For a
Pi 5 connected to CAM0, the relevant `/boot/firmware/config.txt` overlay is:

```text
dtoverlay=arducam-pivariety,cam0
```

After rebooting, verify the camera and its aggregate mode before using this
module:

```bash
rpicam-hello --list-cameras
rpicam-vid --list-cameras
```

The HAT normally starts in synchronized four-in-one mode. If composition mode
was changed previously, Arducam documents value `0x00` as four-in-one; on a Pi
5 CAM0 their documented I2C bus is 6:

```bash
sudo i2cset -y 6 0x24 0x24 0x00
```

Only run that command on a kit whose `i2cdetect -l` output matches Arducam's
composition-mode instructions.

## Efficiency choices

- `--nopreview`: no display or GUI work.
- `--denoise cdn_off`: disables the extra colour-denoise pass.
- `--low-latency`: selects the lower-CPU `ultrafast`/`zerolatency` x264 preset
  on Pi 5.
- `taskset --cpu-list 1,2,3`: keeps capture and encode threads off the
  repository's timing-critical CPU 0.
- `nice -n 5`: makes the recorder yield to higher-priority experimental work.
- 8 Mbit/s is about 1 MB/s, 3.6 GB/hour, or 14.4 GB for four hours before
  small overhead. A fixed-duration call reserves 20% additional headroom.

Pi 5 has no hardware H.264 encoder. The ISP scaling is hardware-assisted, but
H.264 necessarily consumes CPU. Raspberry Pi's published 1080p30 measurements
put low-latency encoding at roughly 0.7-0.8 of one CPU core at comparable
bitrates; scene content changes the exact number.

Skipping the encoder is not viable for a four-hour session on a 256 GB drive.
The current `3840x540` YUV420 stream would be about 1.34 TB uncompressed, full
`5120x720` RAW8 about 1.59 TB, and even the camera's lowest native
`2560x400` RAW8 four-feed mode about 442 GB. MJPEG is also software-encoded on
Pi 5 and normally trades substantially more disk space for no dependable CPU
advantage. A materially lower-CPU solution therefore requires either lower
resolution or different hardware with an encoder (for example, a supported
Jetson platform); there is no unused Pi 5 encoder that another API can expose.

To retain the native `1280x720` image from every camera, change
`output_width`/`output_height` in `example_config.json` to `5120`/`720`. That is 1.78x
as many pixels as the default and should be load-tested alongside the actual
experiment before use. For an even lighter `640x400` per-camera stream, use
sensor mode `2560:400:8` and output size `2560x400`.

The four-hour intermediate is already H.264-compressed but intentionally uses
a fast encoder preset. After the experiment, it can be archived more tightly
with a slower encoder. This cannot restore detail discarded during acquisition;
it only reduces the stored size. It is a full re-encode and should not run
during the time-sensitive task:

```bash
ffmpeg -r 30 -i session_001.h264 -c:v libx265 -preset slow -crf 24 session_001_archive.mp4
```
